#Large data and arranging it properly
Friends = ["Moipone", "Yolisa", "Olebogeng"]
print(Friends)# this would output the names of my friends stated above.

print(Friends[1]) # this would only print a friend's name with respect to their position(index) number
print(Friends[-1]) # this would print a friend's name  acording to their index number but then this starts counting from the other side where as negative 0 is the same as positive zero
print(Friends[1:]) # This only prints out the items from the specified index number tho last item in the list
